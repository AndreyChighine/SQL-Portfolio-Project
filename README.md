Andrey Chighine's SQL Portfolio

Hello, This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects while working through SQL, Power BI, and other data analytics courses. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrey-chighine-7604b2246/) if you have any feedback or questions.

Highlighted Projects
Netflix Movies and TV Shows- SQL: In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze specific data for a later graphic creation on Power BI. Using multitple and combined queries to get the data needed, and also remove unneeded data that will not be helpful for graphic purposes were the bases of my SQL Project. At the end of the project I was able to customized the database based on my needs and the results were as I expected and really good.


Data: Power BI sample data (found on my SQL-Portfolio-Project repository)
Audience: End users
Purpose: Identify trends on Netflix data usage
In this dashboard, I used a Power BI dataset containing sample sales data from 2019 to 2021. Through this sample dataset provides a wider overview of famous types of content, different ratings within Netflix, Countries using Netflix and directors information. I saw an opportunity to strategically visualize clear, actionable insights to any end user that would like to learn from Netflix insights. This dashboard allows my audience to immediately identify geographically and categorically the tastes of Netflix users.
